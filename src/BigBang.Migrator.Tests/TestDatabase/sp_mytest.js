* This is executed as a stored procedure to compute the sum of a specified feature in a collection.
* To avoid script timeout on the server when there are lots of documents (100K+), the script is executed in batches,
* each batch sums the value of the specified feature in the batch docs and returns continuation token.
* The script is run multiple times, starting from empty continuation, 
* then using continuation returned by last invocation script until continuation returned by the script is null/empty string.
*
* @param {String} feature - Feature to be aggregated (required). 
* @param {String} filterQuery - Optional filter for query (e.g. "SELECT * FROM docs WHERE docs.category = 'food'").
* @param {String} continuationToken - The continuation token passed by request, continue counting from this token.
